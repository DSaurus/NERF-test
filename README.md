# NeRF-pytorch


[NeRF](http://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf) (Neural Radiance Fields) is a method that achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes. Here are some videos generated by this repository (pre-trained models are provided below):

This project is a faithful PyTorch implementation of [NeRF](http://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf) that **reproduces** the results while running **1.3 times faster**. The code is based on authors' Tensorflow implementation [here](https://github.com/bmild/nerf), and has been tested to match it numerically. 

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/yenchenlin/nerf-pytorch.git
cd nerf-pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd torchsearchsorted
pip install .
cd ../
```

  ## Dependencies
  - PyTorch 1.4
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - imageio
  - imageio-ffmpeg
  - configargparse
  
The LLFF data loader requires ImageMagick.

You will also need the [LLFF code](http://github.com/fyusion/llff) (and COLMAP) set up to compute poses if you want to run on your own real data.

## How To Run?

### Quick Start

To train a `multihuman` NeRF:
```
python run_nerf.py --config configs/multihuman.txt
```

To test the NeRF by rendering test dataset:
```
python run_nerf.py --config configs/multihuman.txt --render_only --render_test
```

> A neural radiance field is a simple fully connected network (weights are ~5MB) trained to reproduce input views of a single scene using a rendering loss. The network directly maps from spatial location and viewing direction (5D input) to color and opacity (4D output), acting as the "volume" so we can use volume rendering to differentiably render new views
